## Floating IPs
  An IP which will allow access to internal networks, will redirect you to a new internal station to use and will show the internal private IP once accessed. In essence, a redirector.
## OSI Model

## Internet Standards Organizations
  *   IETF - In charge of RFCs index
  *   IANA - In charge of IP addresses, root resolver that can restrict and provides assignments of domains
  *   IEEE - In charge of hardware standards, electrical engineers that manage the devices

## Binary
  Base2, uses only 0 and 1
  
  ```bit, nibble, byte, half-word, word```
## Decimal
  Base10, 0-10
  
  ```1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10```
## Hex
  Base16, 0-9, A-F
  
  ```1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,A,B,C,D,E,F```
## Base64
  64 Symbols, A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /
  
  ```=``` is used to represent a null value

## Networking Topologies
  *  Bus  -  All connected to same terminator line
  *  Star  -  All connected to one device, can communicate through it
  *  Ring  -  All connected one to the next in a circle
  *  Mesh  -  Certain device connected to other ones, if any one goes down, network is still up
  *  Wireless  -  Wireless receiver/router, will communicate through other devices on same interface
  *  Hierarchial  -  Allows segmenting network so only certain device in a certain layer can access certain devices/networks
## Networking Devices
  *  Hubs
  *  Repeaters
  *  Switches
  *  Routers
## Ethernet timing
  *  10Mbps = 100ns
  *  100 Mbps = 10ns
  *  1Gbps = 1ns
  *  10Gbps = .1ns
  *  100Gbps = .01ns
## Lan Technologies
  *  Ethernet - 802.3(x)
  *  Wireless 802.11(x)
  *  Token Ring 802.5
## Data Link Sublayers
  *  MAC  -  Medium Access Control Address is a hardware identifying address to send/receive networking data
  *  LLC  -  Logical Link Control maintains the link to the receiving address
